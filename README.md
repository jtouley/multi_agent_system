# Multi-Agent System for Financial Data Analysis

This project implements a multi-agent system to fetch, analyze, and visualize historical financial data. The system is composed of three agents: Researcher, Coder, and Supervisor. The inspiration for this project comes from Matt Dancho's insightful email and video, which demonstrated a structured approach to data tasks.

## Inspiration

The idea for this project was inspired by Matt Dancho's email, where he shared a video demonstrating a systematic way to approach data tasks using Python. You can watch the video [here](https://www.loom.com/share/8a9efd98e84647bcb9a493a9742c6ba9?sid=4ad65937-58fd-4c56-99e0-f20410465438).

## Project Structure

- **Researcher**: Fetches historical financial data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Coder**: Plots the fetched data.
- **Supervisor**: Coordinates tasks between the Researcher and Coder, and interacts with OpenAI's GPT model to generate responses.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `yfinance` for fetching financial data
- `matplotlib` for plotting
- `openai` for GPT-based responses

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/multi_agent_system.git
   cd multi_agent_system

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set the OpenAI API key:**
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key'
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```

## Running the Project

Execute the script:
```bash
python multi_agent_system.py
```

The Supervisor will manage the workflow, ensuring that the Researcher fetches the data and the Coder plots it. Additionally, the Supervisor will interact with OpenAI's GPT model to generate responses related to the task.

## Example Output

The output includes:

- A plot of the historical closing prices of the specified stock (e.g., SCHG).
- Text responses generated by the GPT model related to the financial data analysis.

## Acknowledgments

- Matt Dancho for the inspiration and his educational video.
- OpenAI for providing the GPT model.
- Yahoo Finance for the financial data.
